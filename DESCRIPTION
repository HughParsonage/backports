Title: Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: Provides implementations of functions which have been
    introduced in one of the R's base packages since version 3.0.0. These
    backports are conditionally exported which results in R resolving the
    function names to the version shipped with R (if available), or the
    implemented backport as fallback. This way package developers can make use
    of the new, optimized functions without without worrying about the minimum R
    version required.
