Title: Some backports of functions introduced since R-3.0.0
Version: 1.0
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides backports of functions which have been
    introduced in one of the base packages in R version 3.0.1 or later. These
    backports are conditionally exported in order to let R resolve the function
    name to either the implemented backport, or the respective base version, if
    available. This way, package developers can make use of the new, optimized
    functions without without worrying about the minimum R version required.
