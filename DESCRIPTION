Description:
    Backports of functions which have been introduced since R
    version 3.0.1. The backports are conditionally exported in order to
    let R resolve the function name to either the implemented backport, or the
    respective base version, if available. Package developers can make use of
    new functions or arguments by selectively importing specific backports to
    support older installations.
