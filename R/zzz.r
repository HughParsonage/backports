#' @description
#' This package provides backports of functions which have been introduced in one of the base packages in R version 3.0.1 or later.
#' These backports are conditionally exported in order to let R resolve the function name to either the implemented backport, or the respective base version, if available.
#' This way, package developers can make use of the new, optimized functions without without worrying about the minimum R version required.
