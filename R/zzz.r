#' This package provides functions which have been introduced in one of the base packages in R version 3.0.1 or later.
#' These backports are conditionally exported in order to let R resolve the function name to the implemented backport only if the respective base version is not available.
#' As a package developer, you can just import \code{backports} to use all implemented backports without worrying about the required R version.
